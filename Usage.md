The Task Tracker App is a simple and easy-to-use desktop application that helps you manage and track your tasks with a built-in Pomodoro timer. The app allows you to add tasks with customizable durations, save and load tasks from a local database, and receive notifications at the end of each work session.

Using the Task Tracker App
--------------------------
The Task Tracker app consists of a timer display, task list, and several control buttons.

1. Timer display: The timer displays the remaining time for the current task or break. The default work time is 25 minutes, and the default break time is 5 minutes. You can change the work and break durations by adjusting the values in the corresponding spinboxes.

2. Task list: The task list displays your tasks along with their index number. To add a task, click on the "Add Task" button and enter the task description. To remove a task, click on the "Remove Task" button and enter the index number of the task you want to remove.

3. Timer controls: The timer controls include Start, Stop, and Reset buttons. Click on "Start" to begin the timer, "Stop" to pause the timer, and "Reset" to reset the timer to the initial work duration.

4. Saving and loading tasks: To save your current tasks to the local database, click on the "Save Tasks" button. To load previously saved tasks from the local database, click on the "Load Tasks" button.

Receiving Notifications
-----------------------
When the timer reaches the end of a work session, you will receive a notification, prompting you to take a break. Similarly, at the end of a break, you will receive a notification to resume work. These notifications help you stay on track and maintain a healthy balance between work and rest.
