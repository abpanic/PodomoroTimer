In this blog post, I'll be discussing the build process of a custom Pomodoro Timer created for my use case. This project also showcases my product management skills. Let's dive into the details.

# The Build Process
## Visual Studio Code
I started by creating a new file in Visual Studio Code with the filename "PomodoroTimer.py" and added an initial scaffolding to outline the main components of the application. The initial code looks like this:

[Initial code]

The initial code is just the scaffolding of the application, and it's okay not to have all the components functional in the first go. However, running the initial code in VSCode should launch the app, and that's precisely what happened.

Next, I added the rest of the code components to ensure the application is functional and performs the tasks it's supposed to.

Now, the application is coming up nicely, and we can run it from the terminal with python3 PomodoroTimer.py.

The application launches and the timer starts. However, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) should have features that go beyond basic functionality. It should include features in the initial phase that make users want to use it more.

So, I focused on two unique features to set it apart from other Pomodoro timers available in the Ubuntu snap store:

An alarm sound that the user can hear, allowing them to reset the timer.
The ability to launch the application with a double click on Ubuntu.
To implement these features, I made the following changes:

## Adding Alarm Sound
I used the pygame library to add the alarm sound feature:

## Making the Application Executable with Double Click on Ubuntu
To make the Python script executable with a double click on Ubuntu, I followed these steps:

Add a shebang line to the script.
Make the script executable.
Associate the script with the Python interpreter.
(Optional) Create a desktop shortcut.

With these enhancements, it's now time to work on creating a distributable version of the pilot application.

## Distributing the App
To convert the Python script into a Debian package (.deb file), I followed these steps:

Install required tools.
Create a directory structure for the package.
Create a script to run the application.
Create a debian/control file.
Create a debian/rules file.
Create a debian/changelog file.
Ensure the presence of a setup.py file.
Create a debian/compat file.
Build the Debian package.

Now, I have a .deb file that I can distribute and install on Debian-based systems using the dpkg -i your_package_name.deb command.
